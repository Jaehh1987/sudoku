Project Description

This project is to develop my ability to use a objective oriented concept
with Java & JavaFX and practice peer development using GitHub.
My interest in Sudoku game has been extended to select it as the subject in this project.
When an user run the program, it will generate a new Sudoku solution to be solved.
Created game will be displayed to GUI using JavaFX and the number of empty box is decided by
difficulties user selects.
